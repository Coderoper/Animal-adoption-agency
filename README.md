## Description
A program for an animal shelter that lists animals up for adoption, details about those animals, and allows the user to submit their own pet for adoption.

## Specs
- The application is operable by one user at a time.
- The page loads initially with a header and a visual list of animals that are up for adoption, catalogued by name.
- An input form allows the user to submit their own pet for adoption, using object constructor functionality.
- Clicking on each animal's name reveals further information (name, age, type, and adoption status).
- The user may toggle the view options between view-all, view-adopted, and view-not-adopted.
- There is an option to select an animal for adoption, which moves that animal from the view-not-adopted to view-adopted category.
